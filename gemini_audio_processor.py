You are analyzing a senior living client intake conversation (either audio or text).
Extract the following information and return it as JSON:

{
  "care_level": "string (must be exactly one of: 'Independent Living', 'Assisted Living', 'Memory Care')",
  "enhanced": "boolean (true if they need Enhanced Assisted Living - higher medical care, nursing support, diabetes management, oxygen, etc.)",
  "enriched": "boolean (true if they need Enriched Housing Program - apartment-style with support services, meals, housekeeping, transportation)",
  "budget": "number (maximum monthly budget in dollars, extract just the number. If not mentioned, use null)",
  "timeline": "string (must be exactly one of: 'immediate', 'near-term', 'flexible')",
  "location_preference": "string (preferred ZIP code as 5-digit string OR city/area description like 'West side of Rochester'. If not mentioned, use null)",
  "special_needs": {
    "pets": "boolean (true if they have pets)",
    "apartment_type_preference": "string (if mentioned, e.g., 'studio', '1 bedroom', '2 bedroom')",
    "other": "string (any other special requirements)"
  },
  "client_name": "string (if mentioned, otherwise null)",
  "notes": "string (any additional important information)"
}

IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS:
- "Independent Living": Client is largely self-sufficient, needs minimal assistance
- "Assisted Living": Client needs help with daily activities (bathing, medication, meals)
- "Memory Care": Client has dementia/Alzheimer's requiring specialized care
- "Enhanced": Higher level medical care with nursing support (diabetes management, oxygen, foley/ostomy, injectable meds, etc.)
- "Enriched": Apartment-style supportive services (meals, housekeeping, transportation)
- "immediate": Needs to move in 0-1 months
- "near-term": Needs to move in 1-6 months
- "flexible": Timeline is 6+ months or unspecified

CRITICAL RULES:
1. For "care_level", use EXACTLY one of the three options listed
2. For "timeline", use EXACTLY one of: "immediate", "near-term", or "flexible"
3. For "budget", extract ONLY the numeric value (no $, no commas)
4. For "location_preference" (IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY):
   - **PREFERRED**: Extract 5-digit ZIP code if mentioned (e.g., "14534", "14611", "14618")
   - Look for phrases like "ZIP 14534", "in 14611", "near 14618", "close to ZIP 14534"
   - If ZIP is implied by area name, infer the ZIP code:
     * "Brighton" or "Brighton area" = "14618"
     * "Pittsford" = "14534"
     * "Webster" = "14580"
     * "Penfield" = "14526"
     * "Greece" = "14626"
     * "Downtown Rochester" or "central Rochester" = "14604"
     * "West Rochester" or "west side" = "14611"
     * "East Rochester" or "east side" = "14618"
     * "Rochester area" or "anywhere in Rochester" or just "Rochester" = "14604" (default to downtown)
     * "anywhere" without city = null
   - If city/area mentioned WITHOUT specific ZIP and not in the list above, use the area description
   - If nothing location-related is mentioned, use null
5. If something is not mentioned, use null (not "unknown" or empty string)
6. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no extra text

Extract all available information from the conversation.

    Consultant: I understand. What's your budget for monthly costs?

    Client: We can afford around $6,000 per month, maybe a bit more if it's really good.

    Consultant: And when are you looking to move her in?

    Client: Ideally within the next 2-3 months. We'd like to find something soon.

    Consultant: Do you have a preferred location or area?

    Client: We live in the 14534 ZIP code area, so somewhere close to that would be ideal. She also has a small cat that's very important to her.
